Corewar
======

The corewar is a game where small programs written in assembly fight each other in the memory of a virtual machine.
The project is composed of 3 parts :

  * The assembler that parses assembly files and converts them to byte code.
  * The virtual machine where the fight takes place
  * The champion, a program that fights in the arena
